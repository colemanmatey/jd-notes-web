- **Import Strategy**: Updated all imports to use centralized export structure
- **Build Optimization**: Improved bundle size and build performance

### Improved
- **Code Organization**: Better separation of concerns and maintainability
- **Type Safety**: Prepared structure for TypeScript migration
- **Performance**: Optimized component rendering and API calls
- **Developer Experience**: Cleaner development workflow and debugging
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without affecting existing code

### Technical Details
- **Bundle Size**: 268.84 kB (optimized for production)
- **Build Time**: ~1.61s (efficient development workflow)  
- **Dependencies**: React 19.1.0, Vite 7.0.5, Tailwind CSS
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/notes`, `/api/health`

## Development Notes

### Breaking Changes in v2.0.0
- Component import paths have changed due to reorganization
- Legacy component exports maintained for backward compatibility
- Service layer abstraction replaces direct API calls

### Migration Guide
```javascript
// Old imports (still supported for backward compatibility)
import LoginForm from './components/LoginForm';

// New recommended imports
import { LoginForm } from './features/auth';
import { Button, Input } from './components';
```

### Future Roadmap
- TypeScript migration for enhanced type safety
- Enhanced testing coverage
- PWA features (offline support, caching)
- Advanced state management (Redux Toolkit/Zustand)
- Performance optimizations (React.memo, useMemo)
- Accessibility improvements
